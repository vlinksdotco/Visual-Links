Visual, Social &amp; Anonymous Search Engine.

ABOUT

VLinks (formerly Visual Links) - It is a Visual, Social and Anonymous web search engine created ( and still evolving) to search for information on Internet with a visual display of search results (Visual aspect). Search results presented with list of logos (visual links) in "visual way" and not in an old "text way" (a lot of text links) like other search engines. The content is contributing by users - you can add your own favorite sites (Social aspect). We do not collect or share personal information. We do not tracking you and care about your privacy (Anonymous aspect). Reach the parts other search engines can't reach.

WHY:

Because people don't like text, people like icons.

HISTORY:

All the idea started from : "one picture is worth a thousand words". Today, when you want to find something on Internet you go to search engines (like Google, Yahoo, Bing and others) and in the result you have a lot of text links. So we decided to build a new visual search engine. When you want to search something with our search engine, you will not get back text links, you will get icons that links to websites. We called them visual links or just vlinks.
